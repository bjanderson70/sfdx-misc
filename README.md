# Salesforce SFDX Misc

This repo provides tools to assist with transitioning from *HappySoup* to DX.

## DX Project Shell Scripts
This document outlines the shells scripts defined to support the DX Project initiative. 
These scripts (bash) provide a means to accelerate and encapsulate common behavior. 
It should be noted, these scripts are very much dependent upon SFDX command line (CLI) behavior 
and will likely change over the evolution of SFDX CLI.

## SFDX CLI
Understanding general functionality of SFDX CLI is needed. This comes into play when 
authorizing access to a non-ScratchOrg or ScratchOrg. Many of the commands expect a 
username/target-name (-u) to reference the Org. For example, a common command to 
see what Orgs (and Scratch Orgs) one has available, __sfdx force:org:list â€“all__:
