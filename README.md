# Salesforce SFDX Misc

This repo provides tools to assist with transitioning from *HappySoup* to DX.

## DX Project Shell Scripts
This document outlines the shells scripts defined to support the DX Project initiative. 
These scripts (bash) provide a means to accelerate and encapsulate common behavior. 
It should be noted, these scripts are very much dependent upon SFDX command line (CLI) behavior 
and will likely change over the evolution of SFDX CLI.

## SFDX CLI
Understanding general functionality of SFDX CLI is needed. This comes into play when 
authorizing access to a non-ScratchOrg or ScratchOrg. Many of the commands expect a 
username/target-name (-u) to reference the Org. For example, a common command to 
see what Orgs (and Scratch Orgs) one has available, __sfdx force:org:list â€“all__:

## Manifest
Below are a list of the shell scripts defined for the DX Project.

|Script name	| Description |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
:---        | :--- |
| analyzeOrg.sh| Utility  analyzes a Salesforce Org |
| buildScratchOrg.sh | Utility builds a Scratch Org with needed packages (i.e. FSC) |
| createProject.sh | Utility creates a VS Code Project; seeded with an unmanaged Package from Sandbox |
| dotGen.sh | Utility to pull metadata dependencies and create a visualization (Graphviz) |
| md_used.sh | Utility to pull down the metadata used in an Org |
| sfdxUrlEncrpt.sh | Utility to encrypt a SFDX URL stored token |
| packConfig.sh | Utility to set environment variables |
| setScratchOrgJSON.sh | Utility to create a project definition file for a scratch Org |
| csvSheets.sh | Utility to create CSV files [awk] |
| filterPackages.sh | Utility to get installed package names and corresponding package Ids [awk]|

## Tools Used
In order to limit the dependencies of these shell scripts, all shell scripts (bash) 
utilize the following (tools natively found in Unix environments) aspects:
* awk,
* grep,
* sed,
* cut 
* bash (shell script)

The two non-standard tools utilized are :
* SFDX CLI
* Graphviz (dot)
## Configuration
Each user is required to add the DX bin path to their PATH environment variable. At the 
time of this writing it is not certain where these scripts will reside. 
However, for example, if the DX project resides in the following directory 
(and assuming a git-bash shell installation on Windows), /c/salesforce/workspaceDXProject.
One would add the following to their resource file (either ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile):
